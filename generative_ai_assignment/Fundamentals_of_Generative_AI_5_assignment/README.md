### 1. **Compound AI Systems**
   - **Definition**: These are AI systems that combine multiple AI models or components to perform complex tasks.
   - **Example**: A system that uses both a language model (like ChatGPT) and an image recognition model to generate descriptions for images.

### 2. **AI Agents**
   - **Definition**: AI agents are autonomous programs that use AI to observe their environment, make decisions, and perform actions to achieve specific goals.
   - **Example**: A virtual assistant like Siri that listens to your voice commands, understands them, and takes actions like setting reminders or sending messages.

### 3. **Relation between Compound AI Systems and AI Agents**
   - **Definition**: AI agents often use compound AI systems to improve their decision-making and task execution by leveraging multiple models or techniques.
   - **Example**: A self-driving car (AI agent) that uses a compound AI system combining object detection, route planning, and traffic prediction models.

### 4. **Difference between Fine-Tuning and RAG**
   - **Fine-Tuning**
     - **Definition**: Adjusting a pre-trained AI model's internal parameters using new, specific training data to improve its performance on a specific task.
     - **Example**: Fine-tuning a language model on medical documents to make it better at understanding medical terminology.
   - **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**
     - **Definition**: Enhancing an AI model by allowing it to access external information sources dynamically during its operation.
     - **Example**: A chatbot that retrieves the latest news articles from the web to provide up-to-date answers without having to re-train the model.
